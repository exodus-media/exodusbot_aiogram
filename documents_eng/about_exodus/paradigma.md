# Description of various ways of interaction in a decentralized network of trust

For the development of a decentralized network of trust, which will serve as a basis for decentralized social security, insurance, and design, the following modules are proposed:
- Providing mutual assistance, developing and expanding the reference network of trust;
- ‚ÄúClearing of mutual obligations‚Äù as a prerequisite for p2p cooperation;
- ‚ÄúVirtual register of mutual intentions‚Äù for each pool of participants;
- Ways of organizing "social design".

## Providing direct targeted assistance, developing and expanding the reference network of trust

This method is a prerequisite for the emergence of a decentralized network of trust, in which there is no fear of being deceived. 
It is based on the manifestation of circles and reference networks of trust, in which ‚Äúdirect targeted mutual assistance‚Äù is carried out.
 
The network is built on the principles of personal participation in a community where basic trust among people already exists. And as the network forms on the principle of giving and not on acquiring, people who are focused exclusively on their own benefit are being cut off. 
 
The network is built as a social graph, the vertices of which are network participants, and the edges are relations of mutual assistance, expressed in the form of intentions and obligations.

- Each user determines his current state according to the "traffic light" principle: I am ready to help network members, I don't need help now ‚úÖ,I need monthly support, I can help other network members üîÜ, I need emergency assistance for a limited time üÜò.
- All who participate in the fundraising, see the situation details: the amount of the request, how many people are participating in the collection, the amount already collected, and the one left to collect.
- Help is provided voluntarily, without compensation, harmlessly for the person providing it.
- Aid can be provided in a non-monetary form, but the system uses a single equivalent for all acts of aid.
- The amount of non-monetary aid is estimated in the same way as non-monetary contributions in non-profit projects. The specific value is determined in the dialogue between the one who provides and the one who receives help. It depends on their circumstances and common sense.
- One always chooses themself the participants from their network they want to help.
- The more people you support, the more powerful will be the network you can turn to for help, when needed.
- The intention can be corrected or withdrawn at any time without explanation.
- An intention translated into an obligation is not revocable and must be performed.
- Transactions regarding someone's support are visible to all participants of their circle and are not visible to those who do not participate in that support.
- Assistance is provided directly, without a "general fund" or mandatory contributions.
- The system is cyclical and dynamic, with a cycle of 1 month. This allows the formation of circles of monthly support and adjustment of the network, depending on the activity and interests of the participants.
- Network growth occurs when members of one support circle begin helping members of another support circle.

The network develops a kind of relationship "my friend's friend is my friend." Exodus exhibits relationships between the following categories of participants:
- who supports me;
- whom do I support;
- who else supports the one who helps me;
- who else supports the one I help;
- who else is helped by those who support me;
- who is helped by those whom I support;

Thus develops a decentralized network, where the participants are connected by relations of voluntary disinterested assistance and the fulfillment of obligations. 

## "Clearing of mutual obligations" as a prerequisite for p2p cooperation processes

- To help people in difficult life situations, it is necessary not only to ensure their basic needs, but also to involve them in some creative activity. They should gain productivity and capacity for action, the ability not only to receive help but to provide it within their powers.
- Along with the monetary form, the assistance may be provided in the form of services, through the sharing of equipment or instruments, the provision of premises and other forms of non-monetary exchange and free voluntary labor.
- Different types of assistance are recorded in a single equivalent, which allows for the clearing of obligations within the network of participants. Low-income participants can assist someone using their skills, attention, time, or any other sort of resource. 
- Network members can offer each other services for friendly-prices, making them more affordable than at the market. An increase in the number of mutually beneficial activities leads to increased material goods and reduces the difficulties to access those goods for all involved.
- Such an approach becomes the basis for cooperation in a network of trust, reduces overall costs, solves everyday problems, promotes resocialization, helps people find employment and constructive interaction, and strengthens healthy social connections.

In the future, such networks can form internal demand and supply for the production and consumption of goods and services, with direct supplies and minimal costs.

## "Virtual register of mutual intentions"

Participants of a targeted assistance network may create a pool for future joint support in certain emergency situations. Guarantees of help for each other make relationships within the network more stable. The consequences of probable emergency cases become more predictable.
Cases can be both unexpected and undesirable (accident, fire, illness) or expected (wedding, training, large purchase).
 
- Those wishing to enter the pool use the principle of ‚Äúmutual guarantee.‚Äù Participants form a register of records of their intentions to support any participant involved in one of the previously agreed emergency events. 
- Participants of the virtual register themselves determine the rules and algorithm for their interaction in case of occurrence of an insured event: notification rules, validation check, response time, the form of assistance, minimum and maximum amount of assistance, etc.
- There is no centralized fund involved in this agreement, and the participation amount of each member does not exceed the amount previously recorded in the register.
- When providing direct targeted assistance in an emergency, the response of network participants is voluntary and unpredictable. In contrast, the participants of the virtual register agree in advance on their guaranteed participation. Violation of this agreement excludes them from the pool.
- The virtual guarantee-register allows you to create agreements on significant amounts of assistance and guarantee their reimbursement according to the rules adopted in the pool without unnecessary bureaucracy.
- Each case's credibility is checked through the social connections of those participating in the pool, knowing each other directly or indirectly through participation in common circles of targeted assistance.

Each case's credibility is checked through the social connections of those participating in the pool, knowing each other directly or indirectly through participation in common circles of targeted assistance.

From this point on, we can assume that the network has the features of a decentralized network of trust, limited by the size of the shared pool. This opens up opportunities for non-arbitration direct cooperation among participants offline, gives a sense of social security - a kind of insurance. It also creates conditions for the multiplication of the process, since each new participant increases the pool's volume and the associated network capabilities.

Unlike multi-marketing systems, there is no advantage of the former over the latter, no one has the advantage of disposition or ownership.

In essence, this is an alternative system of social and insurance security, capable of replacing the corresponding state and public institutions at the expense of greater efficiency and lower costs.

## A way of organizing "social design" in a decentralized network of trust

Social design" is why all existing "institutions" were created, and together form what we call the state. Ministries and departments, governments and institutions did not arise at the behest of the Monster, but 2000 years ago, by the light hand of some Roman senator who invented the court, the prosecutor's office, and the whole construction of law -- from his head. For the sole purpose of one goal - to increase the common good and one's own.
 
In a decentralized network, ‚Äúsocial design‚Äù is done in a fundamentally different way.

- When the pool of participants becomes bigger, and the amount in the virtual register of mutual intentions grows, there is an opportunity to develop social projects of common interest. 
- A decentralized network of trust allows the organization of processes similar to crowdfunding, crowdfunding, and crowdsourcing. 
- The peculiarity is that the first step is to assess a certain initiative's relevance among the network members who vote for it with their intentions. 
- The sufficiency of resources in the form of common intentions of the interested is a confirmation of an initiative's relevance, just as it is the condition for its implementation.  
- This form of participation allows many to "agree" and be part of the common. 

The proposed method will enable you to quickly determine how relevant the concept is for the network participants, and the sufficiency of resources for its implementation. It helps coordinate the intentions of all those who support a particular project and are interested in its execution.

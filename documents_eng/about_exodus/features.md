# Features of the direct targeted assistance and the development of a decentralized network of trust in the Exodus concept

The Exodus concept allows you to organize assistance in many different cases, according to unified rules and algorithms for a large number of participants, both in need of help, and those able to help others.
- help is provided directly to the person who asks for it;
- assistance is provided voluntarily, free of any repay, and "harmless" for the person who provides it;
- you can see different requests in your network, provide assistance yourself or invite friends through a referral link;
- the approach fosters a relationship of giving for the benefit of all involved;
- the approach encourages, instead of supporting one collection, optimizing the voluntary contributions of users among different network participants;
- the network is built on the principle of referral links between friends, who are linked by basic trust and willingness to provide assistance when needed;
- personal acquaintances and recommendations from other members confirm the reliability of a request for assistance;
- The Exodus bot only records the assistance expressed in a monetary equivalent, though it is possible to consider non-monetary aid as well. To do this, the participants should estimate the "value" of the non-monetary assistance, focusing on the average market indicators of this kind of service/work/good, etc. Assistance is always provided free of repaying and disinterested - but not without record. Therefore, for accounting, it is necessary to digitize acts of mutual assistance. 

- The system only records the fact of requesting or providing assistance, there is no monetary or any other exchange within it;
- the network itself is not an intermediary in the fulfillment of obligations, there is no collection and distribution center;
- the network operates on the principles of transparency and publicity of contributions among members of one network segment, yet it is invisible to those who are not included in that certain local network;
- the network may expand when participants from different segments meet around the same object of care;
- the network is more oriented towards optimizing the funds that participants are willing to share, than ensuring the success of a particular collection;
- the organizer works in cycles (starting a new cycle on the 1st of every month), which allows organizing both temporary assistance and constant support for those who regularly need it.

Using the network, you can raise funds covering the basic needs of dependents, create emergency collections in situations of force majeure, receive monthly support for people of creative professions, teachers, doctors, or volunteers. In the current version, assistance is provided to individuals; one participant can create one collection at a time.

In such networks of mutual assistance, it will be possible to ensure sustainable work for the non-profit sector professionals, support creative projects, raise funds for initiative events, etc.

Circles of mutual assistance in reference communities create conditions for inclusion in social activity and improved living conditions for people who have fallen into a difficult life situation, due to economic crisis, illness, temporary loss of work, etc. Dependence on unfavorable financial circumstances is reduced due to the mutual exchange of services, donation instead of selling, the attraction of various forms of support (material, financial, psychological, career, etc.).

The Exodus concept is an entirely decentralized and open approach, the logic of interaction based on the principles of mutual trust, open information exchange, and due to this, an increase in the speed of transactions and the absence of redundant costs. 

The basis for the emergence of such a network is the willingness to provide assistance to the members of your circle and fulfill your obligations in time. Formalizing such relations using a bot or other application allows interactions with members of other circles and multiplies the network effects. The expansion of the personal network happens by helping more participants. Thus, the balanced redistribution of the resource occurs, covering the maximum number of those in need in a single moment. Help is provided voluntarily, harmlessly to the giver, and free of repaying.

In essence, this is the formation and implementation of an alternative social security system, which is devoid of the shortcomings of the current one. The reason for the existence of the state is the enhancement of the common good. In today's bureaucratic and hierarchical system, there is a high cost of supporting the institutions and the low efficiency of their performance for the sake of enhancement of the common good. In modern conditions, a decentralized system allows both targeted support and realization of common goals - efficiently, and in the absence of redundant costs. It provides dynamic coordination of private and common interests.

The Exodus paradigm was created for sensible people who share principles of benevolence, the sincerity of intentions, desire for cooperation, non-violence, and mutual assistance. The Exodus approach does not allow anyone to be deceived. No sophisticated means of protection are needed - in such a model, everything is transparent to everyone, there is nothing to steal. There is no possession, no advantage of one, no possibility to harm the other. Exodus leads to the world with no “tax on the meaningless”, and no violence and sacrifice. Yet, there is consent, confidence in the future, responsibility, and all the possibilities for self-realization among the same creators of a new reality. A reality to benefit the peace and prosperity of all living beings.

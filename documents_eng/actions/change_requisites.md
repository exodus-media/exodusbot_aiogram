# How to set and change your payment details

This menu option in the profile allows the user to set or change the requisites (payment details) for receiving or providing Support.
The default value is "ask in person".

The user can set these details, correct or delete them.

There are the default credentials displayed publicly in the field of user information.
When Fulfilling an Obligation, the Supporter can choose a convenient option of several possible ones.

Each payment information consists of two entries: name and value.
You may set the details in any chosen format: there may be a card or e-wallet number, mail for PalPay, a link to a source for donations, etc.

Your payment details are recorded in the table [requisites](../tables/requisites.md). The name field contains the name of the requisite (card, wallet, etc.), the value field contains the value itself (card number, wallet number). Next, you set a flag to mark the preferred requisites - is_default.

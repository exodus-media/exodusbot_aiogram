# Request to convert the Intention into the Obligation

In the personal organizer, you may view the actual [Intentions ❤️ and Obligations 🤝](../glossary/glossary.md) in your favor from the other network participants (👥-> 👤).

If there are any, then at any time till the end of the current month you may ask any participant who declared an Intention in your favor to convert their Intention into the Obligation. In this case, that participant will receive a corresponding [notification](../notifications/request_for_translation.md).

# View the participants of the Exodus network and expand your Circles

By providing or accepting Support, you form your own network with the other participants. This feature allows you to view all the members of the other users' networks.

For each participant, you may see brief information about them - [status](../actions/change_status.md) and the current progress of their fundraising. 
For the ["Orange 🔆"](../statuses/orange.md) status participants, the amount of Intentions in their favor ❤️ and the left amount of the funds needed 🙏 are shown. 
For the ["Red 🆘"](../statuses/red.md) status participants, the sum left to and the fundraise and the remaining period in days are shown.

You may also expand your circle, executing the following operations:
- as soon as you sign in the bot, you get our own Circle of Support -> Each member of your Circle also has the other Circles visible for you -> You may go through the Circles of the members of your network, and the "Orange" ones that are not yet in your Circle will be added to you Circle.

These links are collected in [the Circles of Support table](../tables/circle.md). A pair of uid and pid values ​​indicates the connection of these users with the id data (an edge of the social graph).

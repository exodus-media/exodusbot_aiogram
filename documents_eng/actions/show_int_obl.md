# How to view and manage your current Intentions and Obligations

In the personal organizer, you may view your current [Intentions ❤️ and Obligations 🤝](../glossary/glossary.md) in favor of the other network participants (👤->👥).

You may select any intention or obligation from the list and make appropriate actions with them:
- [Adjust, cancel or execute an Intention](correction_my_intention.md)
- [Convert an Intention into an Obligation](creation_of_obligation.md)
- [Fulfill an Obligation](money_transfer.md)

- You may also [remind the Aid Receiver to confirm the Obligation Fulfillment] or [confirm the Fulfillment of the Obligation in your favor 🤝-> 👍](confirmation_of_transfer.md).

At the end of the month, all your Intentions that were not converted into Obligations are reset to zero, and the participants in whose favor these nulled Intentions were are excluded from the [list of the members who receive Support from you](list_my_people.md). And you are excluded from theirs [lists of Supporters](list_other_people.md) as well.
The Fulfilled Intentions and Obligations, in the case you provide this Support regularly, are automatically extended for the next month as the Intentions and may be further adjusted.

Obligations Fulfilled and Unfulfilled on time are removed to the corresponding archives in the personal organizer:
- [Archive of the Fulfilled Obligations](archive_my.md)
- [Archive of the Unfulfilled Obligations](archive.md)

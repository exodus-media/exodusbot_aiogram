# Fulfillment of the obligation

In the personal organizer, you may view your current [Intentions ❤️ and Obligations 🤝](../glossary/glossary.md) in favor of the other network participants (👤-> 👥).

To Fulfill an Obligation, you should make a transaction to the Exodus member "In Need" (the payment details of the Aid Reciever are shown in their user profile) or Fulfill the Obligation in another form discussed and agreed with the Aid Receiver.

Then you should mark in your organizer: "The obligation is Fulfilled", and its status is changed to [Fulfilled Obligation 🤝-> 👍 waiting for Confirmation](confirmation_of_transfer.md). In this case, the Aid Receiver gets [a notification of the Obligation Fulfillment](../notifications/obl_fulfilled.md).

In the MVP bot, information about transactions pending confirmation is available in the main menu to both the Supporter and the Aid Receiver.

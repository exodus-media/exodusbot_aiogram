# How to adjust, execute or cancel an Intention

In the personal organizer, you may view your current [Intentions ❤️ and Obligations 🤝](../glossary/glossary.md) in favor of the other members of your circle 👤-> 👥.
Any Intention may be adjusted or canceled with no explanation or when the particular Obligation was considered unnecessary in discussion with the other members of the same Circle of Support. Comparing the sum of their Intentions with the amount of Needed Support, the Circle members may consider how successful the current fundraising is, and then decide whether the general Support is sufficient in the particular case. Depending on this, you may increase or decrease the sum of your Intention.

When you Fulfill your Intention, you may immediately report this, then it immediately gets the status [pending confirmation of the Obligation 🤝-> 👍 Fulfillment] (confirmation_of_transfer.md). In this case, the Aid Receiver gets a [notification of the Obligation 🤝-> 👍 Fulfillment](../notifications/money_transferred.md).

The Aid Receiver may also view [all current Intentions and Obligations in their favor(👥-> 👤)](show_int_obl_for_me.md) in the personal organizer.

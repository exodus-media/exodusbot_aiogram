# Viewing and managing Intentions and Obligations in your favor

In the personal organizer, you may view the current [Intentions ❤️ and Obligations 🤝](../glossary/glossary.md) in your favor from the other network members (👥-> 👤).
You may proceed these options:
- [Request to translate the Intention into the obligation](request_for_transfer.md)
- [Retention or Cancellation of obligation](save_obligation.md)
- [Request to fulfill obligation](request_for_execution.md)

Also in the main menu, you may remind their Aid Receiver to confirm the Obligations Fulfilled in this Aid Receiver favor, as well as you may [confirm 🤝-> 👍](confirmation_of_transfer.md) that the Supporter from your Circle Fulfilled their obligation in your favor.
At the end of the month, all the Intentions that were not converted into Obligations are set to zero, and thus the connection between these network participants is considered not established.
The Fulfilled Obligations, in the case the Support is provided regularly, are automatically extended for the next month as the Intentions and may be further adjusted.

Fulfilled and Unfulfilled on time Obligations are removed to the corresponding archives in your personal organizer:
- [Archive of the Fulfilled Obligations](archive_my.md)
- [Archive of the Unfulfilled Obligations](archive.md)

# Reminder of the Fulfillment of the Obligation or confirmation after doing this

As soon as the participant "In Need" receives the [notification that Support has been provided](../notifications/obl_fulfilled.md), they have to check and verify this. Only after that the Supporter receives the [notification on the Obligation Fulfillment confirmation by the Aid Receiver](../notifications/obl_received.md), and the information about the transaction goes to the [archive of fulfilled obligations](archive_my.md) both for the Supporter and the Aid Receiver.

If the Supporter does not receive the confirmation for a long time, they may send an additional [reminder to the Aid Receiver](../notifications/reminder_to_confirm.md) through the main menu, where all pending notifications are displayed. They may also contact the Aid Receiver at any source beyond the bot chat and ask to check and confirm the Fulfillment of the Obligation.

Unconfirmed Obligations are considered Unfulfilled and at the end of the month are removed to the [archive of Unfulfilled Obligations](archive.md).

Since the Obligation Fulfillment confirmation by the Aid Receiver is a key factor in the operation of the decentralized network of mutual assistance according to the Exodus principles, this function has been moved from the personal organizer to the main menu.

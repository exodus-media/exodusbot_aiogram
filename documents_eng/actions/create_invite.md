# # Create a link-invitation to ask for Support for yourself or those members In-Need of your network

This menu option allows you to see the list of the Exodus participants "In Need" from your Circles of Support and share their call for aid through a special link __🔗Help__ with the other people, even those who are not members of the Exodus bot yet. By clicking on the link, its receiver can:

1. Join the Exodus network, if they are not a member of it yet, and then (if willing) Support the Inviter or the one who is invited to help.

2. Provide Support to the participant indicated in the invitation.

The invitation link may either be generated or stored in the database (in the ref field). The same link is displayed in the information about the selected user.

# How to declare an Intention

The user receives a link request for support or selects a participant "In Need" from the personal local network.
If you are willing to Support any member with the ["Orange 🔆"](../statuses/orange.md)status, you need to create an [Intention ❤️](../glossary/glossary.md) first. 

The Intention may be further [adjusted](correction_my_intention.md).
The other members of the particular Circle of Support may track the progress of the fundraising in favor of the particular user by comparing the amount of declared Intentions with [the amount of needed Support 🙏](../glossary/glossary.md). That's how the participants may decide whether their help is sufficient in the particular case.

The more Exodus participants you Support, the [wider your Local Decentralized Support Network](../actions/show_circle.md) becomes. 

The participant, towards whom the Intention is declared, receives a [notification](../notifications/intention_created.md) about it.
The members of this participant's [Circle of Support](list_other_people.md) may also receive notifications.

When asking for emergency Support from the ["Red 🆘"](../statuses/red.md) status, there are no Intentions created, but the Support is accepted immediately in the format of Obligations.

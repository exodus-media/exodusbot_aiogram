# Archive of the Obligations not Fulfilled on time

All the Obligations that were neither confirmed of being Fulfilled in the previous period nor canceled by the Aid Receiver are automatically removed to the Archive. This archive is available for both the Supporter and for the Aid Receiver and contains information about Unfulfilled Obligations in your favor and your own Unfulfilled Obligations in other participants' favor.

Thus the Supporter who didn't Fulfill their Obligation automatically quits the [list of the particular user's Supporters](list_my_people.md), and the Aid Receiver, disappears from that Supporter's [lists of participants In-Need](list_other_people.md) as well.
Even though in case the Supporter who didn't Fulfill their Obligation completes that transaction from their archive, then the connection between them and the Aid Receiver is restored, and the record is removed to the [Archive of Fulfilled Obligations](archive_my.md).

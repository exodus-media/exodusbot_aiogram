# How to delete your account from the bot

Whenever you first enter the bot or click the Support link, you get registered in the Exodus bot.
By default, the user gets the status [Green ✅](../statuses/green.md).

If the user is not going to provide direct targeted support according to the Exodus system principles, then this menu option allows you to:
- remove your account from the bot database;
- reset all your user data;
- cancel the current Intentions and Obligations in your favor as well as your own ones to anyone else's favor;
- stop receiving notifications from the bot.

Re-registration in the bot is possible, but all previous data will be lost and connections with other users will have to be built from scratch.

_The question is topical: "Whether to save and restore the archive of previously fulfilled obligations in case the user returns?"_ - By now the data is deleted completely.

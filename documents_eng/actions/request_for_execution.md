# Request to Fulfill an Obligation

In the personal organizer, you may see the current [Intentions ❤️ and Obligations 🤝](../glossary/glossary.md) in your favor from the other network participants (👥-> 👤).

Any user may ask for Fulfillment of the Obligation at any time. In this case, the Supporter receives a [notification with a request to convert the Intention into the Obligation](../ notifications / request_for_translation.md).

The Supporter should [Fulfill this Obligation](obl_fulfilled.md) within 24 hours or contact the Aid Receiver at any suitable source outside the bot to discuss the possibility of providing the promised support later.

Obligations may be [Canceled by the Aid Receiver](show_int_obl_for_me.md). If the Supporter fails to Fulfill their Obligation or Intention within a month, they are excluded from the Circle of Support of the particular Aid Receiver.

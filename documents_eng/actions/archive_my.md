In the personal organizer you may see all the Fulfilled and Confirmed Obligations, both from you and in your favor, including the date when the Fulfillment of the Obligation was received.

Obligations that were not fulfilled on time in the previous month are removed to the [Archive of the Unfulfilled obligations](archive.md)

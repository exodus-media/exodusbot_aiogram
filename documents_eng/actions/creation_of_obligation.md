# How to translate an Intention into an Obligation

In the personal organizer, you may view your current [Intentions ❤️ and Obligations 🤝](../glossary/glossary.md) in favor of the other members of your Local Decentralized Support Network  👤-> 👥.

If you are sure you can provide Support to smb before the end of the month, you may convert your [Intention ❤️ into the Obligation 🤝](../glossary/glossary.md). In this case, the Aid Receiver gets a [notification](../notifications/obligation_created.md). The other members of the same Circle of Support may receive the notification, too. The Obligation reduces [the amount of the left needed Support 🙏](../glossary/glossary.md), which is in the Aid Receivers profile and is shown to the other members of the Circle.

The Obligation should be Fulfilled and cannot be canceled by the Supporter themselves. The Aid Receiver may at any time [ask for the Obligation Fulfillment](../actions/request_for_execution.md). The Aid Receiver also may [Release / Refuse to commit](../ actions/save_obligation.md) the Obligation.

A few days before the end of the month, the user who declared their willing to support receives [an automatic reminder that the due date is approaching](../notifications/reminder_of_obligation.md).

The Obligation not Fulfilled on time is removed into the [Archive of Unfulfilled Obligations](actions/archive.md).

_In the future, a module for clearing (mutual settlements) among the network participants with the use of the Obligations is planned_.

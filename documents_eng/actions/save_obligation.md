# Keeping or canceling an Obligation in your favor

In the personal organizer, you may see current [Intentions ❤️ and Obligations 🤝](../glossary/glossary.md) in your favor from the other network participants (👥-> 👤).

Having received a notification about the Obligation declared in your favor from any of the members of your Circles of Support, and then until the end of the month or special fundraising period, you may decide to Keep that Obligation, Cancel it or [Ask for Fulfillment](request_for_execution.md).

The participant whose Obligation has been canceled is excluded from the [Circle of Support for this user](list_other_people.md).

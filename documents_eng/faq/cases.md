# Possible Cases for Using the Exodus Bot

**Providing basic income for dependents**: children, parents, disabled people, sick, families in difficult life situations, temporarily losing their jobs, etc. Help is provided to those in need directly and directly. Personal complicity excludes fraudulent fees. Distributed attention reduces the burden on each caregiver. The Exodus system seeks not to keep a person in the position of only receiving, but helps to get out of a difficult situation with connections and competencies. Recipients of regular assistance participate in mutual exchange as much as they can.

**Cashier of mutual assistance**. Insurance assistance among the circle of agreed participants. The ability to quickly alert and help each other in a situation of temporary difficulties among a circle of friends.

**Basic income for creators and non-monetized professions**. During the crisis, many creators, musicians, artists, writers found themselves in limited conditions. Platforms like Patreon spend a significant part of the transferred funds on self-service. Exodus helps make the support format for creators by their connoisseurs simple, direct and transparent. The creator can freely create and not think about his daily bread or ways to sell his labor.

**Representatives of the non-profit sector**. Now the activities of many NGOs depend on grants, and this is a restriction on the use of funds, a large amount of reporting, distracting from direct assistance. Exodus can help with direct collection to individuals to reduce reliance on grants for business continuity. Can help with fees for new organizations or informal communities.

**Gathering for general events**. Using the Exodus bot, you can make the process of collecting funds for general events transparent, be it going out to barbecue, the monthly work of a hobby club, or a creative festival. The bot allows you to see that the initiative has not collected a sufficient number of interested parties and to abandon its implementation before starting to spend real funds.

**Emergency fees**. Wedding, funeral, buying a car, building a house, teaching children. Fire, accident, treatment. Start-up capital.
Sometimes people need to raise a fairly large amount in a limited time. Exodus allows you to notify your friends about this kind of need and get one-time support for free.

**Benefactors and patrons**, using the Exodus bot, get the opportunity to choose the circles of their care, provide assistance to those who are closer to them, find like-minded people, optimally distribute their funds to a wider circle of those in need, reduce the costs of intermediaries and unproductive spending. Solving this problem of social well-being of society, on which their own directly depends.

**Accounting for rendered gratuitous services**. Mutual assistance can also be provided in a non-monetary form - consultation, massage, lesson, renovation, transport services, provision of premises, etc. All these forms of assistance can be converted into cash and recorded as a fulfilled obligation. It helps to include people who have no money in productive interactions. Helps to start appreciating "free" "services. This can stimulate non-monetary exchanges of services, taking people out of the zone of forced helplessness from lack of money

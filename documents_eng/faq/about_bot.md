# About Exodus bot

Bot Exodus provides technical accounting and management of direct targeted agreements of participants in the reference network for the provision of mutual assistance and support.

The bot has a two-tier mechanism for balancing assistance between a pool of participants through a system of freely adjustable intentions and binding obligations. Thus, it is possible to optimize the distribution of voluntary assistance among network participants. Transactions are recorded in financial terms, in this version of the bot, the measure is USD.

The bot is not a payment system; it records the need for assistance, the situation of assistance, and displays a network of participants united by common support intentions. Exodus by default assumes the format of a direct gratuitous gift from an individual to an individual. But everyone who asks for help and provides it can agree on convenient formats for its provision and the form of payments, despite the fact that direct agreements and calculations are outside the bot.

For each user, the bot shows a list of helpers 👥-> 👤 and a list of those it helps 👥-> 👥, as well as their status and current collection situation. The bot allows you to call your friends for help. The local referral network of trust grows through the system of referral links on the principle ""my friend's friend is my friend."" The expansion of the network occurs in the event of a ""meeting"" of participants in local reference networks through general situations of assistance.

The estimated period of work of the bot is one month. At the end of the month, there is a transition to a new period. Those who did not take an active part in assistance or who did not fulfill their obligations fall out of this reference network of trust and mutual assistance.

The basic principles of interaction in a bot between network participants - assistance is provided directly, distributed, decentralized, voluntarily, harmlessly, mutually beneficial, open to participants in the reference network.

Formalization of acts of mutual assistance in a single equivalent is a precondition for the emergence of a web of trust that has no numerical limitations, boundaries and visible form.

The bot allows you to create large enough distributed networks of mutual trust, invisible from the outside for those who are not involved in mutual assistance relations. Thus, an alternative system of mutual social insurance arises - the basis of new decentralized social relations.

In the future, on the basis of reference communities and their expansion, decentralized networks of mutual social security, cooperative interaction, and a self-sufficient p2p economy may arise.

The bot works in Russian and English.

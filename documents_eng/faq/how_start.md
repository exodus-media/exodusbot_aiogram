# How Do I get started in the bot and add members to my network?

The growth of the network starts with who needs help.

## Scenario 1: You need help. You are not on anyone's network yet.
1. You register in the bot using the start link (testbot-https://t.me/Exodus_test_bot or workbot-https://t.me/exodus_commitbot). The default registration status is ✅.  
**NB**: _In the test bot, you can study the interface and experiment with the script for providing direct targeted assistance_.
2. Decide where the bot users can turn to contact you or get to know your situation better - it can be a social network, chat in a messenger, a website, etc. - any resource convenient for you.
3. Fill in your 👤Profile data:
- **✅Status** - change status to 🔆 regular assistance or 🆘 emergency assistance, indicate the amount of the fee.
- **💬About me** - you can enter brief information about yourself and a link to the discussion (optional, limited to 180 characters).
- **💳Details** - you can set the details for providing financial assistance (bank card, payment system, link to the collection service, etc. By default, "" ask in person ").
4. Now you can copy the referral link **🔗Help** and send it to your friends.
5. Friends who are ready to help you get into your network and can also use a bot for mutual assistance.

## Scenario 2.
1. You want to organize a collection of help for a friend according to Exodus principles and are ready to help him. In this case, you yourself do not need help.
2. You explain to your friend what to do to start creating an autonomous reference network.
3. Your friend acts according to scenario 1, sends you a link to help himself, indicate the amount of possible help as an intention and get into your friend's network.
4. You can invite other friends you know to help your friend and help other members of this network.

## Scenario 3.
1. Your friend sends you a referral link and explains how to use the bot.
2. You answer “yes”, indicate the amount of possible assistance as an intention and fall into your friend's network.
3. Now you can both help other participants and request help for yourself by changing the status to 🔆 or 🆘.
4. You can invite your friends to the network through referral links to help members of your network.  


The network is built on trust relationships, formalizing existing relationships in small groups. The network expands when local networks "meet". The more participants you help, the more opportunities for mutual support you got.

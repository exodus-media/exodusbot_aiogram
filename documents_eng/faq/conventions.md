## User status:

- 💰 - the amount of monthly or emergency assistance, set in the profile when changing the status, can be adjusted in the profile if necessary. 
- ❤️ - volume of intentions. The intention shows the willingness of the network participants to provide assistance and allows you to balance the amount of this assistance in a particular case (the more willing to help - the less the amount of each). The intention can be adjusted or withdrawn freely. Translated into on-demand or readiness obligations.
- 🤝 - the amount of the obligation. This is a fixation of an agreement to help that cannot be revoked. Liabilities can be kept until the end of the month period or presented for execution.
- 👍 - fulfilled obligation. Execution is confirmed by the beneficiary.
- 🙏🏻 - amount of missing aid. Decreases as intentions are translated into obligations and their fulfillment. The total amount of intentions is compared with the amount of assistance required. The network participants, adjusting their intentions, seek to reduce this amount to zero.

# Notification about the other member's of your Circle of Support status change

As soon as a user changes their status, the members of their Circle of Support receive notifications about it.
As soon as the status is switched to the ["Green ✅"](../statuses/green.md), the members of your Circle will receive just a notification about it. 
In case you switch to ["Orange 🔆"](../statuses/orange.md) or ["Red 🆘"](../statuses/red.md) statuses, the notifications for the other members of the Circle will also contain:
- the offer to provide support
- and the option to see the list of the members of [your Circle of Support](../actions/show_circle.md) who are already helping you.

To get the mailing list, refer to [the circle table](../tables/circle.md).

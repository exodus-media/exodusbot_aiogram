# Reminder of the need to confirm the Fulfillment of the Obligation in one's favor

If the Supporter does not receive the confirmation of the Fulfillment of their Obligation from the Aid Receiver for a long time, the Supporter may send an additional reminder to the Aid Receiver. This may be done through the main menu, where all the Obligations Fulfillments waiting for confirmation are shown.

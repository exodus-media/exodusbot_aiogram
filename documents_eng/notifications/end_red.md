# Notification of the completion of the emergency fundraising

The "Red 🆘" emergency fundraising counts completed in any of these two cases:
1. the required sum is raised on time
2. the declared period of funding has ended.

In case the fundraising is successfully complete, all members of that certain Circle of Support receive a notification:
- every member of the Circle of Support who have fulfilled their Obligations will receive a special thanks for their support;
- the members who declared the Obligation, but did not have time to fulfill them (it is possible in case the total amount of the declared Obligations to this "Red" user overnumbers the required amount of Support), will receive notifications on the cancellation of their Obligations.
- the other members of this Circle of Support are informed about the successful completion of the emergency fundraising in their Circle.

In case the fundraising is partially complete:
- every member of the Circle of Support who have fulfilled their Obligations will receive a special thanks for their support;
- all the Obligations that have not been fulfilled in favor of this Aid Receiver are retained;
- all members of this Circle of Support receive notifications about the completion of the fundraising and its results.

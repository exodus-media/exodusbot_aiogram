# Glossary

There are three types of __User statuses__:

- __[Green ✅](../statuses/green.md)__ - "I am ready to support other network members, also I am not in need right now". The payment details of the "Green" user are concealed. By helping other participants, the user expands a personal referral network.
- __[Orange 🔆](../statuses/orange.md)__ - "I need monthly support; I can still support other network members". The "Orange" user declares the amount of monthly support needed 💰. The members of their Circle of Support see the amount of the Intentions ❤️ in their favor and the remaining amount of needed fund 🙏.
- __[Red 🆘](../statuses/red.md)__ - "I need urgent support within a limited time". The user asks for support, describes their emergency case, sets the required amount of funds💰 and the deadline for gaining it ⏳.

__Intention ❤️__ – __Intention ❤️__ – declared sum you are willing to provide to the particular funding in the Exodus referral network. The Intention is presented as a note visible both to you and the other Supporters of that particular user.
When your Intention is declared, you reveal the other network participants who are ready to support the same user. There is how Circles of Support are being formed based on the particular object of care.
Declaring an Intention, you make a connection with all the other Supporters and the certain user In Need.
The main purpose for the Supporters is to raise the required pursue by participating personally and involving friends. Each Intention decreases the needed aid amount by its cost.
In case you want to change or withdraw your Intention, you do not need to give an explanation. If you withdraw an intention, you will quit the Circle of Support to that particular user.

__Obligation 🤝__ – declared sum that the Supporter guarantees to fund to the participant "In-Need" of their choice. The Obligation may be fulfilled either in monetary or any other form by mutual arrangement reached beyond the system.
The Obligation may be stored by the Aid Receiver or be called for an account at any moment arranged by the parties. The Aid Receiver has to confirm the fulfillment of the Obligation. The unfulfilled Obligation is put down and impacts the User's reputation. The fulfilled Obligations remain in the archive. Obligations that are not fulfilled in time are also filed away into the archive. The Aid Receiver can forgive any unfulfilled Obligation in their favor.

__Help requested 💰__ - the amount of monthly or emergency support set in the user profile [status change](../ actions / statuses.md], may be adjusted if necessary.

__The amount of Support needed 🙏🏻__ - A dynamic indicator of the funding's success. While the support is just declared, this indicator is equal to the requested amount 💰, then it decreases as the Intentions are converted into Obligations and get fulfilled. The total amount of Intentions is defined by this value. 
The aid of the members of a certain Circle of Help is to reduce this amount to zero, adjusting their Intentions and coordinating each others' actions in the Circles.

__Obligation fulfilled 👍__ - When the Aid Receiver has confirmed the fulfillment of the Obligation in his favor, there will be a note of the transaction which will be immediately put to the archive of Fulfilled Obligations available for both Supporter and Aid Receiver.

__Overdue obligation ⌛️🤝__ - If the Obligation is not fulfilled or confirmed on time, it is moved to the archive of Overdue Obligations. The number of Overdue Obligations affects the reliability of the user that did it.

__Keeping an Obligation__ - The Obligation that is not presented for fulfillment, but is kept until presentation. As the basis for the prospective development of the Exodus ecosystem, there will later be an opportunity to use Obligations in your favor as a fulfillment for your Obligations to other participants of your referral network.

__Offsetting Obligations__ - A procedure of fulfilling the Obligations among the network participants by using mutual Obligations as an exchange.

The elements of a decentralized network of trust and the Exodus ecosystem:

__Circle of Support__ - A group of people who provide direct support to the same Exodus user;

__Local Decentralized Support Network__ - This means that Exodus network participants are linked together through common Circles of Support;

__Virtual pool of the Intentions__ - the group of the Exodus network participants who have declared their will to provide mutual support in agreed cases;

__Referral network__ - the group of participants of a social network of trust, that are supporting each other's initiatives, organizing crowdfunding, crowdinvesting, crowdsourcing, etc.
The network is expanding as soon as the number of participants who receive regular support, and those who accepted an invitation to the Pools of Intentions, and the participants of the social initiatives increases.

__Social engineering__ - Attracting support and resources from network members to implement common initiatives and projects.

__P2P economy__ - A relationship of direct exchange of goods and services between users in a decentralized network of trust.

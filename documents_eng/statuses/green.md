# Status: Green ✅

The "Green" User status indicates their willingness to provide aid to the members of their Circle of Support.

The principles of rendering support are:
  - voluntary participation,
  - harmlessness,
  - funding only the cases that resonate with you.

The "Exodus" targeted direct aid system allows you to provide charitable support to those in need - directly, bypassing the intermediate instances and the tax levied on transactions.

As a "Supporter", you can see the other members of your Circles of Support, both other "Supporters" and those "In Need". Therefore you can optimize your funds' distribution in coordination with other members of your Circles of Support.

The general intent of the Exodus participants is to promote as many network members as possible from the "Red" and "Orange" statuses - "In difficult life situation" - to the "Green" status - "Can provide support to the others". The well-being of every member of the network is the basis for overall well-being.

Participating in common fundings helps to reveal the network members with similar interests and to expand your referent circles of "friends".

The transactions are open, and the communication is transparent, so you are provided with all the conditions for trusting relationships with the other participants of this decentralized network built on the principles of providing well-being for everyone. This means the foundation for the growth and development of the decentralized network of trust.

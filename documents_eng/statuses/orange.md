# Status: Orange 🔆

The "Orange 🔆" status of the user indicates that they need regular monthly assistance. The user in such a status can provide aid to the other members of their Circles of Support, building mutually supportive relationships. The User puts [their data](../actions/about_me.md) and [other details](../actions/change_requisites.md) (such as payment details needed to get help) in their profile. The User also sets [the required amount of monthly support 💰](../actions/change_status.md) and does it by themselves, basing upon their own needs and their justification.

"Orange 🔆" status may be set by the Exodus members who are in a difficult life situation, temporarily or permanently (job loss, illness, incapacity, disability), as well as by those who are involved in non-monetized but socially significant professions and activities (creators, non-profit associations' activists, philosophers, open-source solutions' developers, etc.).

Having this status, you can invite your friends, allies, and backers to the network as members of your Circle of Support. The User's Circles consist of those with whom they provide mutual help to each other. The User's Circles network expands by including more "Supporters" and those "In Need" from the other referent Circles.

The main characteristics that are shown for a participant in this status are the amount of intentions to help ❤️ and the amount of aid missing 🙏.

1) If you are willing to provide aid to smb, you should first [indicate the intent to Support](../actions/create_intent.md) and set a possible amount of fund. You may also suggest nonmonetary aid, but it is formally priced in a single monetary unit - here in an MVP bot it is euro). You may freely [adjust, withdrawn, or immediately execute your Intentions](../actions/correction_my_intention.md). The executed Intention reduces the amount of Needed Aid 🙏=🙏-👍.

2) Till the end of the month, you have to [convert your Intentions into Obligations 🤝](../actions/creation_of_obligation.md) or [cancel](../actions/correction_my_intention.md). The Aid Receiver may ask you to [convert your Intention into Obligation](../actions/request_for_transfer.md) at any time since the Intention is set, without waiting for the end of the month.

3) The Obligation reduces the amount of Needed Aid 🙏 seen by the other Circle of Help members: 🙏=🙏-🤝. The aim is to reduce the Needed Aid amount 🙏 to zero within one month.

4) All the Obligations [should be fulfilled](../actions/money_transfer.md) by the end of the month. (In the long term, it will be checked by offsetting the Obligations through the "chains" of Users.)
The Aid Receiver has to [confirm the fulfillment of the Obligation](../actions/confirmation_of_transfer.md). Then Fulfilled Obligations 👍 are stored in the [archive](../actions/archive_my.md).

5) At the end of the month, the network's balance is recalculated:
- For those Circles' of Support members who indicated their Intention, but did neither converted it into Obligation nor fulfilled it: your Intention is reset to zero, which leads to your quitting the Circle of Support for that Aid Receiver.
- For those who fulfilled their Obligation: your Obligation is automatically prolongated for the next month as an Intention and can be canceled or adjusted.
- For those who have Unfulfilled and Unconfirmed Obligations since the previous month: your Obligations are transferred to the [archive of unconfirmed obligations](../actions/archive.md) and must be fulfilled later. One's Obligations' nonfulfillment may affect trust to that particular Circle member. The Aid Receiver has an option to [cancel the Obligation](../actions/save_obligation.md) from any Supporter. 

When the User changes their status from "Orange 🔆" to ["Green ✅"](../statuses/green.md), the Intentions in this User's favor are canceled, but the Obligations given to them remain and must be fulfilled.

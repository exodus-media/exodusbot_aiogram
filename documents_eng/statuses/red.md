# Status: Red 🆘

The "Red" User's status indicates the case of emergency and the necessity of urgent support. The User puts the [information about force majeure](../actions/change_chat_link.md) and the [details required to get support](../actions/change_requisites.md) (such as payment details, etc.) in their profile, ibid [sets the amount of fund needed 💰](actions/change_status.md), and the deadline for its raising (which should be completed within the current month). This User's status is seen by the members of their Circle of Support.

1) If you [change your status](notifications/status_changed.md) to "Red", all the members of your Circles will see it and will know you need urgent support.
2) In cases of emergency support, you may provide help as an Obligation 🤝 only. Each Obligation reduces the amount of Required Aid 🙏=🙏-🤝 seen by the other Circle's members.
3) The Obligation in such cases of emergency [must be fulfilled](../actions/money_transfer.md) before the end of the funding period.
4) The Aid Receiver must [confirm the fulfillment of the Obligation](../actions/confirmation_of_transfer.md) in his favor.
6) As soon as the amount of the fulfilled Obligations 👍 equals or exceeds the declared sum requested 💰, the funding is considered completed.
7) In case the total Obligations amount in the User's favor exceeds the amount required, the Obligations that have not yet been Fulfilled are Canceled, which is reported as a [notification of the completion of the emergency funding](../notifications/end_red.md).
10) As soon as the required sum is made up, or the declared period is over, the "Red" user returns to his previous status.

Completing the emergency cases first is the lead principle for all Exodus network participants. But the principle of voluntariness and feasibility of Support also remains important - the Supporter may consider the situation of force majeure as unreliable or insignificant to himself and leave the Circle of Support of the user In Need. Although they may remain to have common circles through connections with the other members of those Circles.

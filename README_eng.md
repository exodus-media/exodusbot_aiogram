Exodus is a concept that describes a method, strategy, tactics, algorithms, and tools -- for the self-organization of communities into a single decentralized network of trust. The concept is based on the principle of mutual guarantees; its implementation produces conditions for direct cooperation, decentralized social security system, social design, p2p economy, and many more.

# Developments within the Exodus concept

1. [The processes of development and interaction within the decentralized network of trust](documents_eng/about_exodus/paradigma.md) are described:
- Development of trust-circles and referent networks of trust, based on “direct targeted mutual assistance.”
- "Clearing of mutual obligations" as an organization of the p2p cooperation process.
- “Virtual register of mutual intentions” for each pool of participants.
- A method of "social design" that allows you to determine the relevance of an initiative, along with the sufficiency of resources for its implementation.

2. We described [algorithms and rules for maintaining records of mutual intentions and obligations](documents_eng/about_exodus/algoritms.md). That allows organizing the interaction of participants of a network to implement these tasks.

3. For additional applications, the Exodus platform is available - a comprehensive solution aimed to fully support the ideology and ecosystem of Exodus and their future expansion. The core of the system registers joint initiatives, provides tools for solving typical tasks of social groups, keeps accounts of intentions and obligations, along with the rules for their transformation and fulfillment. The platform has a developed API for the creation of external applications. [Exodus platform on GitHub](https://github.com/exodus-today/exodus). 
[A web version](http://exodus.today/) is released on the platform, adapted to desktop computer browsers which have their own user web-interface. [Video review of the web version of the Exodus organizer (in Russian)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeEKVYUlom8&feature=youtu.be).

4. A working prototype of a Telegram-bot is released, manifesting and expanding the network of participants according to Exodus principles, for organizing direct mutual assistance in reference networks (communities).

# Exodus Bot

Exodus Bot is a tool for decentralized targeted assistance in referent networks - for friends, acquaintances, members of thematic communities, etc. Using a bot, you can regularly support those who need it, and grow the community members' useful activities. The bot is responsible for the notification of users and the possibility of helping each other in case of emergencies. The bot keeps lists of people who help and support each other, which is necessary for the further development of the decentralized network of trust.

You can check out the work and interface of the bot here - __https://t.me/Exodus_test_bot__. This is a test version of the bot; here, you can simulate and study its operation and interface. It does not require you to fulfill obligations, yet their fulfillment is essential for work according to the Exodus concept principles. 

A working bot __https://t.me/Exodus_commitbot__ is similar to the test-version; transactions are recorded in a conventional unit equivalent to the euro, the fulfillment of obligations is a condition for correct operation.  

Before clicking on a bot, understand the principles of its operation and symbols:

# Exodus Bot as a prototype

# Invitation

We continue to develop Exodus-tools for the common good. We will be improving digital products, and we invite you for any form of collaborative development, testing, distribution, and improvement.   
You can use the products as they are or create your own solutions based on the proposed algorithms. You may act as users with your wishes and needs or as developers with your suggestions. We are at the very beginning of the path and are ready for cooperation with everyone with whom there is co-thought and agreement.

# Telegram chats for user and developer support

- To inform users on the current version of the Exodus bot, [a channel: Exodus_canal_1](https://t.me/Exodus_canal_1)
- Technical support for the Exodus bot users, [a chat: Exodus_Help](https://t.me/Exodus_Help)

# Who already develops the Exodus approach:

[The Exodus Social Club](https://www.facebook.com/EXODUSSOCIALCLUB) is an open community of people interested in developing creative cooperation and mutual assistance using modern communications -- in decentralized networks based on the Exodus paradigm.

[Exodus Charitable Foundation](http://www.exodus.social/) - the mission of the foundation is to provide financial, and any other support to creators (artists, writers, performers, etc.), with the aim to give them social protection, encouragement, and promotion of various forms of their creative activity.
